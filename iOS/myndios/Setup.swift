/**
 This struct contains variables that are stored in permanent user defaults by `AppDelegate` when the app is first started. There are two types of variables:
 - *Initial variables*: These are variables that users may change during use, e.g., their name.
 - *Permanent variables*: These are important experimenter settings, e.g., encryption and transfer, as well as important credentials, like the WebDav upload user and password for the current study. They can only be changed here, and not through the user interface. The app needs to be recompiled and restarted if these settings are changed.
