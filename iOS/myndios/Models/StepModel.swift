/**
 Hardware preparation steps can be *regular* or *short*, which was implemented to progress faster through preparation after having done it several times. Videos or images can be presented alongside a preparation step. Optionally, a step can be locked until it receives a `CompletionSignal` from the device, and a `CompletionFunction` can be executed as well after a step was completed. Steps can also have a time out, to prevent users from getting stuck.
