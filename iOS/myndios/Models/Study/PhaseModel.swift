 Low-level definition. The `PhaseModel` is the smallest unit in a scenario. Prompt, fixation, and pause phases are implemented.  Duration and marker are set in the trial definition. Duration can be set to `0` for prompts, in which case the phase concludes once the prompt was read out to the subject. Pause phases contain a random jitter between -1 and 1 second that is added to the phase duration automatically. Note: Phases also contain a feedback variable, but displaying feedback is not implemented yet.
