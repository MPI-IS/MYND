import UIKit
import NotificationBannerSwift

/// # Basic settings that span the whole application
/**
 ## Usage
 This class is instanciated automatically as root of the application
 
 ## Features
 - Set the global tint based on the value in Constants
 - Configure switches with the global tint
 - Configure tooltips with the global tint
 - If the user previously signed up, we take them straight to the Scenario Select, otherwise we show the SignUp screen
 - If the app was launched for the first time or was reset, ensure that some defaults are set from the beginning
