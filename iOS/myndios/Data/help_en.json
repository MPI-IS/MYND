We recommend that you unplug all electronic devices that are not needed during the time of the recording (including electronic wheelchairs). We also recommend that you unplug the chargers as well, and that you remove all unnecessary metal objects that may contact your skin."

However, it is fine if you cannot make it to the end. When the time window runs out, the app will automatically present the next set of sessions. It will wait until you started the first session for that day."
