# Credits

The following acknowledges the Maintainers for this repository, those who have Contributed to this repository (via bug reports, code, design, ideas, project management, translation, testing, etc.), media that was used, and any Libraries utilized.

## Software Development
This application was developed by Matthias Hohmann as part of a research project on large-scale neuroscientific experiments at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany. The application has been realized in collaboration with the software workshop of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, in particular with the help of Talha Zaman and Raffi Enficiaud. Both were the leading developers of the Qt protoype of this application. Further assistance was provided by Lukas Grossberger, Christian Förster, Robert Hildebrandt, Michelle Hackl and Brian Wirth. Brian Wirth was the main developer of the Android version of this application.

## Scientific Supervision
The project was made possible by the scientific supervision of Prof. Moritz Grosse-Wentrup at the University of Vienna, and Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.

## Hardware Resources
Development and distribution of the system were made possible by Bernhard Schölkopf and the Department of Empirical Inference at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. Administration of the hardware was supported by Telintor Ntouni and Sebastian Stark. Study logistics were supported by Monika Mergen and Lisa Konieczny.

## Media: icons, images, videos
All media used in this software was created with royality-free work from Pexels. See [](https://www.pexels.com/license/) and [](https://www.pexels.com/terms-of-service/) for license terms. The login view background was created with a video by GamOl from Pexels. Music imagery thumbnail: "Person Playing String Instruments" by Suvan Chowdhury. Resting thumbnail: "Body of Water" by Todd Trapani. Positive memories thumbnail: "Red Flowers in Bloom" by David Bartus. Initial questionnaire thumbnail: "Turned-on Bokeh Light" by Dana Tentis. Motivation thumbnail: "Photo Of A Colorful Ceiling" by Mitchell Luo.

Instructions videos that play during hardware preparation and clean-up show Michelle Hackl, who consented to their use within this software. They were shot by Matthias Hohmann and Brian Wirth.

machines or devices. If You elect to use the SDK in such a way, You
must take steps to design and test Your Applications to ensure that Your
Applications do not present risks of personal injury or death, property
damage, or other losses. The Headband and other software in the SDK may
not always function as intended. You must design Your Applications so that

does not cause damage, including personal injury or death, property damage,
or other losses. If You choose to use the SDK, (i) You assume all risk
that use of the Headband, Application and/or such other software by You or
by any others causes any harm or loss, including to the end users of Your
Applications or to third parties, (ii) You hereby waive all claims against
InteraXon related to such use, harm or loss (including, but not limited to,
any claim that the Headband or any other software is defective), and (iii)
You agree to hold InteraXon harmless from any of the foregoing claims.

Ownership and Confidentiality

You agree that all right, title and interest in and to the SDK or Headband,
in whole or in part, and  all patent, copyright, trade-marks, trade secret
and all other intellectual and industrial property rights therein and
the structure, sequence and organization of same, and the media on which
such material is contained shall, between You and InteraXon, belong to
InteraXon. Your sole rights thereto shall be only those rights granted by
InteraXon under this Agreement.  You agree and acknowledge that InteraXon
has and reserves the exclusive, world-wide right in perpetuity to protect
the SDK and Headband and all product specifications and any part thereof,
under any laws for the protection of intellectual and industrial property,
including without limitation, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights,
industrial designs and patents.

You shall treat the Confidential Information in strict confidence and
shall not disclose, transfer, copy, reproduce, electronically transmit,
store or maintain, remanufacture or in any way duplicate all, or any part
of, the Confidential Information except in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.  You shall be directly liable for the acts
or omissions of Your employees, agents and contractors with respect to
such confidentiality obligations.  You agree to protect the Confidential
Information with the same standard of care and procedures which You use to
protect Your own trade secrets, proprietary information and other confidential
information and, in any case, not less than a reasonable standard of care.

You hereby grant to InteraXon a non-exclusive, worldwide and royalty-free
license to use, reproduce, display, perform, publish and distribute
screenshots, elements, assets, photographic, graphic or video reproductions
or fragments of Your Application, Your name, trade-name or trademark in
any medium or media, solely for purposes of promotion of Your Application
or of InteraXon’s business and technology. This license will terminate
when this Agreement is terminated, except in respect of any documentation
and materials created and distributed prior to the date of termination of
this Agreement.

exclusively by InteraXon. You agree to execute such further documents and
instruments as may be required to confirm such ownership by InteraXon.
